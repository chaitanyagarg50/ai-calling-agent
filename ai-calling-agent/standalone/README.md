## üëÄ Overview
This project is a real-time, voice-based customer interaction system that combines advanced AI, speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and database management technologies. It leverages Deepgram's API for accurate transcription and speech synthesis and Google Generative AI (Gemini) to provide intelligent and context-aware responses. Designed for versatility, the app can handle a variety of use cases, from customer service to domain-specific virtual assistants, with dynamic database integration for personalized and precise interactions. The system is easy to configure, scalable, and offers a seamless way to interact with users through natural, conversational speech.

### Core Functionality:
1. **Environment Setup:**
   - It uses `.env` files to store sensitive information like API keys.
   - Imports multiple libraries for audio processing, database management, and API interaction.

2. **Speech-to-Text (Deepgram):**
   - Captures live audio using `PyAudio`.
   - Streams audio to the Deepgram API for transcription in real-time.
   - Processes final transcriptions when detected and sends them for further action.

3. **Generative AI (Google's Gemini Model):**
   - Configures a customer service chatbot (`GeminiPhoneAgent`) to respond to queries.
   - Uses predefined instructions to simulate professional phone agent behavior, including querying a local database (`SQLite`) when relevant.

4. **Text-to-Speech:**
   - Converts chatbot responses into audio using Deepgram's text-to-speech API.
   - Plays the generated audio back to the user.

5. **Database Integration:**
   - Loads product inventory data into an in-memory SQLite database.
   - Responds to product queries by dynamically constructing SQL queries and processing the responses.

6. **Conversation Flow:**
   - The system starts with a greeting and processes user speech.
   - Uses the Gemini chatbot to respond based on input, including querying the database when necessary.
   - Synthesizes the chatbot's response into audio and plays it back.

7. **Event Handling:**
   - Manages various events like speech detection, metadata updates, and errors during live transcription and streaming.

8. **Exit Handling:**
   - Detects when the customer is satisfied (`EXIT` keyword) and terminates the conversation.

### High-Level Use Case:
This script is for a **customer service application** where:
- Customers interact via voice.
- Queries are transcribed, processed, and answered using a combination of AI and database querying.
- Responses are played back in real-time, providing an interactive, voice-based service experience.

### Tools and APIs Used:
- **Deepgram**: For speech-to-text and text-to-speech.
- **Google Generative AI (Gemini)**: To simulate the chatbot's intelligence.
- **SQLite**: For querying inventory data locally.
- **PyAudio**: For live audio capture.
- **Pydub**: For audio playback.

It is effectively a virtual customer service agent capable of real-time, dynamic responses driven by voice input and integrated systems.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Updating the Database and Initial Prompt
As your application evolves, you may need to update its functionality to cater to different use cases or datasets. For instance, you might want to change the chatbot's behavior to handle a new domain, such as healthcare, education, or retail, or replace the product inventory database with a new dataset. This section provides a comprehensive guide on how to update the database with a new CSV file and modify the initial prompt in the code to adapt the chatbot‚Äôs role and functionality to a new use case.

### 1. **Updating the Database**

The database is loaded from a CSV file (`Products.csv`) into an in-memory SQLite database. To update the database with a new CSV file, follow these steps:

#### Step 1.1: Prepare the New CSV File
- If you just need to update the product details, the new CSV file follows the same structure as `Products.csv`:
  ```plaintext
  Product Name,Category,Brand,Price in Rupees,Stock,Description
  ```
- If the structure differs, you must adjust the `Encode.py` script to reflect the new schema.

#### Step 1.2: Replace the CSV File
- Replace the existing `Products.csv` file in the project directory with your new file.
- Name your new file `Products.csv`, or update the filename in the `Encode.py` script where the CSV is loaded:
  ```python
  df = pd.read_csv('Products.csv')  # Replace 'Products.csv' with the new filename
  ```

#### Step 1.3: Test the Database Loading
- Run the script to verify that the new data is loaded correctly. Look for the message `Database loaded!` in the console output.

---

### 2. **Updating the Initial Prompt**

The initial prompt defines the chatbot's behavior and use case. To change it:

#### Step 2.1: Locate the Prompt
In the `Encode.py` script, find the `initial_prompt` variable in the `initialize_chat` method:
```python
initial_prompt = """
You are a professional phone agent for a customer service department...
"""
```

#### Step 2.2: Modify the Prompt
Replace the text inside the triple quotes with a new use case. Remember to state the columns and give it the first few rows. Also precisely mention how you want the conversation agent to respond.

### 3. **Testing the Changes**

#### Step 3.1: Verify Database Integration
- Run the script and test a few queries to ensure the database is correctly loaded and functional.

#### Step 3.2: Validate the New Prompt
- Interact with the chatbot to confirm it behaves as expected according to the new prompt.

#### Step 3.3: Debug Issues
- If there are errors or unexpected behavior, check the database schema, the prompt logic, and any adjustments made in the code.
